This is going to be a website deployed on a custom domain: https://andreiclodius.com

Testing locally

Website should feel like an operating system. can open windows from header. each window is an app. 

Clean project structure. Logical separation. Monorepo. 
Keep logic in backend as much as possible.

Suggest technologies. 

Keep it simple. will add complexity later. 

##Phase 1: Proof of concept
One window, resizeable, draggable around the screen. Smooth 120fps performance. 

Ask clarifying questions.
